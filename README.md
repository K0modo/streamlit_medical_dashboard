This is a dashboard created for a healthcare insurance company and presents a variety of 
financial data.  Insurance claim information is gathered for policy holders, injury/disease, 
healthcare providers among others.

This dashboard was developed with Python Streamlit.  The data was extracted from a PostgreSQL
database using sql queries and saved to a sqlite database.  Python Pandas was used to filter 
and structure the data for charts and tables.

The data was scraped from the web and illustrates the impact COVID-19 had on the healthcare
industry.  Data referring to members and providers is fictitious however the injury/disease 
and provider specialty codes are standard/common healthcare reporting codes.
